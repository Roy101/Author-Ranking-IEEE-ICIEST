# Author-Ranking-IEEE-ICIEST
As the number of journal issues, conferences and the overall scientific literature have been increasing at an exponential rate, it has become challenging for researchers to find appropriate and useful papers from the vast literature available to them. To solve this issue citation count, h-index, i10-index are used to rank authors. In 1998, Brin and Page introduces the algorithm PageRank which is also used in the scientific community for ranking research papers and authors. However, each of these metrics have their own drawbacks. We hypothesize that papers unveiling deeper truth are often not as well cited as those are more challenging for a wider number of authors to assimilate to their works.So simple count of number of citations may fail to capture the essence of the quality of a paper. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we introduce a new algorithm that also takes into account the quality of a citation of an article received to assign its ranking.We have also included our experimental results. They look promising in ranking authors and papers that are not cited too often due to difficulty in understanding them.
